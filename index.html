<h1> SAG-AFTRA / EMC (AEA-Eligeable) </h1>
<p> So, I spent last week rebuilding my acting website on Wix.com after my old Wordpress site was hacked.  I wanted to do this html excersize using the same content, so compare using a website template versus building from scratch.  <a href="https://elladershowitz7.wixsite.com/mysite/resume"> This </a> is the resume page of my Wix website.  I literally can't even find the resume table part of it or any of the text inside the table.  Where is it hiding? The only recognizable part is the title!  And the basic setup of nesting. </p>
